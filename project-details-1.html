                <div class="detail-text">
                    <h3>1. Project Overview & Vision</h3>
                    <p>Provide a compelling introduction to the project. What is it? What's the core idea or vision? What kind of experience does it aim to deliver?</p>
                    <p>Contextualize the project: Was it for a class, a personal endeavor, or a game jam? What was the overall goal?</p>

                    <h3>2. My Specific Role & Contributions</h3>
                    <p><strong>This is your chance to shine.</strong> Detail exactly what you were responsible for and what you accomplished. Be specific, use action verbs, and quantify your impact where possible.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>[Area 1, e.g., Player Mechanics]:</strong> Designed and implemented the responsive character controller, including movement, jumping, and [specific actions like wall-running or grappling hook] using [e.g., C++ in Unreal Engine].</li>
                        <li><strong>[Area 2, e.g., AI System]:</strong> Developed an adaptable enemy AI behavior tree that allowed for [e.g., patrol, attack, retreat] states, integrating sensory perception (line of sight, sound) and navigation via [e.g., NavMesh system].</li>
                        <li><strong>[Area 3, e.g., Tools/Workflow]:</strong> Contributed to the team's version control strategy using Git, including branching models and conflict resolution. Developed custom Blueprint libraries to streamline common development tasks for designers.</li>
                        <li>(Add more bullet points for your specific, impactful tasks and achievements)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>3. Technical Deep Dive: Mechanics & Implementation</h3>
                    <p>Go into detail about the most interesting technical aspects you worked on. Explain the "how." How were complex features built? What patterns or algorithms did you use? What languages/tools did you use specifically for these mechanics?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>[Mechanic X]:</strong> Briefly describe the mechanic (e.g., "The dynamic weather system"). Then, explain its technical implementation (e.g., "Implemented a data-driven system in C++ that procedurally generated weather patterns based on real-world meteorological data, influencing gameplay mechanics like player speed and visibility.").</li>
                        <li><strong>[System Y]:</strong> Briefly describe the system (e.g., "Modular Inventory System"). Then, explain the technical approach (e.g., "Designed a flexible, extensible inventory using data assets and Blueprint interfaces, allowing designers to easily add new items and define their properties without code changes.").</li>
                        <li>Mention specific APIs, libraries, or engine features you utilized.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>4. Challenges Faced & Solutions</h3>
                    <p>Every project has challenges. This section demonstrates your problem-solving skills, resilience, and learning capacity. Describe a specific technical or design problem and how you overcame it.</p>
                    <p><em>Example: "Encountered significant performance bottlenecks when rendering large open-world environments. Diagnosed the issue using profiling tools and optimized asset streaming and level culling, resulting in a 25% frame rate improvement."</em></p>

                    <h3>5. Lessons Learned & Future Scope</h3>
                    <p>Reflect on what you gained from this project. What new skills did you acquire? What would you do differently next time? This shows maturity and a growth mindset.</p>
                    <p>Consider mentioning any potential future features or expansions for the project, showing foresight.</p>
